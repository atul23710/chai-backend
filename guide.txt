first hmne git init krke repo banai usse pacakage.json bna them isko git pe add kiya repo mei push kiya 
phir baaki ki files banai - .gitignore (iske liye kaafi saare generators ate hai online just usme daalo node aur uske liye file ka content generate krke de dega)
phir ek src uske andr -- index.js app.js constants.js
.env aur .env.sample
aur ek public folder -> temp folder -> .gitkeep 

bs ye abhi structure hua hmra 
ab package.json mei add kro "type" : "module" isse hm import use krr payenge 
aur jaise hme koi bhi change kiya backend mei to phir usko wapas se reload krna hota hai to uske liye bhi kuch krna hoga -- we install nodemon for this what it does ? -- it will reload your project once you did any change
    -- npm i -D nodemon (to install it as dev dependency) 
    -- we also have to add "dev": "nodemon src/index.js" to the pacakage.json 
dev dependencies -- ye sb sirf development mei rheti hai production mei ye nhi jaati to inka production mei koi itna effect nhi hota 
abb kuch folders dekhne padenge  -- controllers db middleware models routes utils (utils will have the repeated functionalities)

it is also suggested to install prettier -- as diff people write code in diff style so to keep the consistency -- npm i prettier 
also we have to add some files with the prettier - .prettierrc (check it) and .prettierignore (kisme nhi lgana .env waale mei aur vscode files mei node_modules)

------------------- lecture 8 ---------------------------
we create a account on mongoDB started a free database cluster, added our username and password in the quickstart section and also add the ip 0.0.0.0/0 which allows all the urls to access -- production mei ip bs ek machine ka add kiya jaata hai jha backend/server ho bs whi and we never allow access from anywhere -- we can also do this afterward via database access for username and pass, network access for ip address 
then wo go to database and choose connect so we get a string that will connect the db just we have to replace the password and add that uri to .env file 
there are two ways of database connection -- one - we can add the whole code to connect in hte index itself and then run it there or we can create a seprate file and then import it and then run it
now we need three pacakages -- dotenv, mongoose, express

mongoose se database connect hoga aur kuch imp points - 
    jb bhi database se baat krnge to error aa skti hai means usse try and catch mei wrap kro 
    database is always in another continent -- time lgta hai -- async await lgana hi padega good practice 
    -- ultimately try catch and async await lgana chahiye whenever we talk to database 
the connection is done in index.js file check it out 
the connections two method will be one in index.js and other one is in the db folder
